# PDX Autoreport

This batch application consumes a YAML report and submits the information to pdxreporter.org.

### Requirements

* Java 11 runtime environment installed
* Functioning account on [pdxreporter](https://pdxreporter.org).

### Usage

TBD - currently the only way to execute the code is by configuring the IDE to execute with a reports.yaml file. I will file tickets to track work to implement the maven package plugin, then provide jar packages on Github/Gitlab for users to leverage.
